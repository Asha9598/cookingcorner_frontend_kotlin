I have made a food recipe app in which it helps to user to see and  the full recipe of any kind of food. 
In this application food recipe is divided into different category. It will be explanation the process of food with images.
In first users need to register in this application to use if they have not done if register is already done they can directly login. 
This application can be also used in real device for example phone, tab and watch.
To run in real device we must connect real device to android studio.
To connect the device we should join usb port to our phone or tab to laptop and allowing in android phone we have to go to setting and clicking seven times in build number
it will pop that you are developer and it show our device name in laptop at last we have to run it.
